Project Description

This project focuses on the analysis and transformation of the Titanic dataset. Using Python and various libraries, we explore, clean, and visualize the data to gain insights into the demographics, survival patterns, and other aspects of the passengers onboard.
Dataset

The Titanic dataset is retrieved from Stanford's CS109 course material. It includes details about Titanic passengers, such as their age, class, fare, family connections, and survival status.
Features of the Project

    Data Loading and Exploration:
        Load data from the provided URL.
        Display initial rows, column names, and dataset shape.
        Generate descriptive statistics.

    Data Cleaning:
        Identify and handle missing values in columns like Age and Survived.
        Use median and mode for filling missing data.

    Data Transformation:
        Added new columns:
            Family: Classifies passengers based on whether they traveled alone or with family.
            Name Length: Calculates the length of each passenger's name.

    Data Visualization:
        Histograms:
            Distribution of Age, Fare, and Survived passengers.
        Scatter Plots:
            Relationships between Age and Fare, and Age and Survived.
        Box Plot:
            Pclass vs Sex.
        Line Plot:
            Fare vs Pclass.

    Correlation Analysis:
        Compute and display correlations between numerical columns.

Libraries Used

    pandas: For data manipulation and transformation.
    matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
    seaborn: For enhanced visualizations.
    numpy: For numerical computations.
    scipy.stats: For statistical calculations.

How to Run

    Clone this repository or copy the script.
    Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy

Run the script using:

    python Titanic_data_transformation.py

    Visualizations and transformed data will be displayed or saved as part of the execution.

Future Enhancements

    Perform feature engineering to improve predictions (if applicable).
    Incorporate machine learning models to classify survival outcomes.
    Optimize data visualization with interactive tools.
